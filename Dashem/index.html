                </p>
                <p>D.T.6 built the Dash &#39;em app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by D.T.6 at no cost and is
                    intended
                    for use as is.</p>
                <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
                    of
                    Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this
                    policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I
                    will not
                    use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I will not be asking you to provide us with any personally identifiable information, since our
                    service doesn’t require collection of any sort of information.</p>
                <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

                <h2>Log Data</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I want to inform you that we don’t log any sort of data. We don’t use any third party products that

                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                </p>
                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                    These
                    are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device&#39;s
                    internal
                    memory.</p>
                <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
                    libraries
                    that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either
                    accept
                    or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse
                    our
                    cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

                    acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
                    method
