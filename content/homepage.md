# Home page!

### Hello there!

I am **Dimitri Tabatadze** (also known as **D.T.6**), and this beautiful website is supposed to be my personal portfolio. I may also write blog-like things here and there. Anyways!

### Who am I?

I am a 16 year old developer based in Georgia. I like working with Javascript and Python, sometimes even with C++! I like tinkering with some problems that I think have beautiful solutions, like landing rockets propulsively, or [using quantum wave function collapse algorithm for generating ugly christmas sweater patterns](https://sweatercollapse.space/?pattern=demo-7.1&n=3&symmetry=0&stitches=1)! I also like working with client side progressive web applications like [cxrili](https://cxrili.netlify.app).

My hobbies include obsessing over spaceflight and rocketry, drawing, doing fun math, playing video games, and searching for the best song ever. I really love rockets and especially if they can perform a soft propulsive landing (like Falcon 9/heavy, Starship, New Shepard, New Glenn, Neutron, Terran R).
