# Home page!

## Hello there!

I am **Dimitri Tabatadze** (also known as _Taraxacum_), and this beautiful website is supposed to be my personal portfolio. I may also write blog-like things here and there. Anyways!

I am a 19 year old CS student based in Georgia. I like working with Rust, C/C++ and other low level. I like tinkering with hard problems, like [landing rockets propulsively](https://github.com/D-T-666/trols), or [using quantum wave function collapse algorithm for generating ugly christmas sweater patterns](https://sweatercollapse.space/?pattern=demo-7.1&n=3&symmetry=0&stitches=1)! I love doing mathematics in my free time.

I am very much interested in mathematics, spaceflight, playing / making video games, and music.
