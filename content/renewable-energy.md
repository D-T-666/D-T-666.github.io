# Renewable energy

## key points

1. what's renewable energy?
   - doesn't run out
   - types:
     - wind farms
     - solar farms
     - hydroelectric stations
     - thermonuclear plants
     - geothermal plants
     - ...
2. what's non-renewable energy?
   - eventually runs out
   - time to fossilize > time to extract & use
   - fossil fuels
     - coal (114)
     - natural gas (53)
     - oil (51)
3. why do we prefer renewable energy?
   - high initial cost
   - cheaper long-term
   - no need for fuel and extraction
   - depends on nature
     - wind
     - sun
     - mass water flow
   - practically doesn't run out
   - good for environment
     - no greenhouse gasses
   - beneficial long-term
4. how do we switch to renewable energy?
   - 19% of our energy is renewable (2019)
   - will be rough
   - serious, slow and steady
   - lay out a good plan
     - majority should agree so no politics
   - we should inform the uninformed
   - will take at least 5 years
5. what's next?
   - make technology consume less electricity
   - work hard on making technology more accessible

## What's renewable energy?

Renewable energy by definition means a source of energy that is renewable and doesn't run out. That may include energy generated from _wind farms_, _solar farms_, _hydroelectric stations_, _thermonuclear plants_, _geothermal plants_, or many others.

## What's non-renewable energy?

Intuitively, non-renewable would mean that something eventually runs out. Our most common source of electricity in fact, will eventually run out! Fossil fuels that we burn for electricity generation such as coal and natural gas, _will_ run out! That's because the time required to fossilize bio-material is far, far greater than the time required to extract it from earth's crust and burn it. It's actually estimated for natural gas to _only_ last 53 more years with current usage trend. (oil: 51, coal: 114)

## Why do we prefer renewable energy?

There are a lot of nuances. Some good and some bad. All though renewable energy has a high initial cost, it's much cheaper to maintain, since you don't need to be constantly extracting more and more fuel. Instead, these technologies depend fully on natural occurrences like wind, mass water flow, and physical properties of certain materials. This also means that they will practically never run out, and and the fact that it wont run out will be very beneficial both in long and short terms.

Renewable energy is also way better for environment, since none of the methods of generating electricity involve releasing tremendous amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. And we all know why that is bad.

## how do we switch to renewable energy?

Good news is that almost 19% of global energy produced in 2019 was from renewable sources! but bad news is that switching to renewables is not easy at all. It has to be taken very seriously and carefully, otherwise it may have far greater drawbacks than benefits in the short-term. We first need to lay out a plan that will work for the majority of the population so that we have as little political backlash as possible. This switch will take at least half a decade. It will require huge areas for wind and solar farms, big valleys filled with water, and so on. Simply put, it's gonna be rough, but worth it.

## What's next?

There are other ways to reduce electricity related pollution, for example advancing technology so that it consumes less and less electricity. We also want to work hard on making clean energy generation more and more accessible for less developed parts of the world.
